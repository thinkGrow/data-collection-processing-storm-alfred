## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- read.csv("Case 1 Data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data <- read.csv("Case 1 Data.csv", skip = 6, header=TRUE)  # Skip the first 5 rows


str(data)
head(data)

colnames(data) <- make.names(colnames(data), unique = TRUE)

head(data)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

colnames(data)
colnames(data) <- make.names(colnames(data), unique = TRUE)
colnames(data)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Y, echo=FALSE}

# Extracting the relevant columns
data <- data[c("ID", "Title", "Location", "Created", "Ended", "Impact", 
                           "Coordinates", "Traffic.conditions", "Diversions", 
                           "Public.transport", "Expected.delay", "Traffic.arrangement")]

# Display the first few rows to ensure the data is correctly extracted
colnames(data)

# Optionally, save the extracted data to a new CSV file
# write.csv(selected_columns, "extracted_road_closures.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
```{r x, echo=FALSE}

head(data)

```
